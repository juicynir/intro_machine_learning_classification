# intro_machine_learning_classification
Introduction to Machine Learning and Classification using Alura's materials. 


In the first commit, intro_ML_class: 

First steps into Machine Learning and Cl√ßassification.
In this script I learned how to make a simple trainning using the library Scikit - Learn.  
From sklearn.svm import LinearSVC, to build the test. 
I also learned how to make the prediction manually and importing accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.

In the sencond introdutory class of Machine Learning, I've learned how to split data into train and test, manually and using Scikit-learn.
I also learned that is vital to balance data porportion.
